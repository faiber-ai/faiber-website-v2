# Theme

 The `Theme` component is used to change the theme of the application. The `Theme` can be set directly in the rx.App.

 ```python
 app = rx.App(
     theme=rx.theme(
         appearance="light", has_background=True, radius="large", accent_color="teal"
     )
 )
 ```

 # Theme Panel

 The `ThemePanel` component is a container for the `Theme` component. It provides a way to change the theme of the application.

 ```python
 rx.theme_panel()
 ```

 The theme panel is closed by default. You can set it open `default_open=True`.

 ```python
 rx.theme_panel(default_open=True)
 ```
